RUM LAGER HOLDER

Sokoban is Japanese for "warehouse manager". Rum Lager Holder is Danish for "Space warehouse manager".

I had the idea of making a 3D Sokoban clone in the year 2000. When I finally got around to looking at it 2 years ago, someone had beaten me to the punch. (3D as in three-dimensional gameplay, not a 3D rendering of a 2D sokoban map)

In the spirit on one-upmanship: this project aims to play sokoban in anywhere between two and six dimensions.

ROADMAP:

- Game engine and tests.
- Level editor with "playable" test mode.
- Game renderer using WebGL.
- Put it all together as a webapp where users can create and play levels.
- Level generator.
- Level solver.
